  Review(score: 5, title: "Great App!", text: "This app is easy to use and extremely resourceful. You are able to see upcoming events near you and use the different filters to help find what you are looking for. You can select the date you are looking for a event, the maximum distance you are looking for, and different categories to help narrow down the type of event that you are looking for. Additionally, the app shows you how much the event will cost you, some being free and some having a cost to attend. I highly recommend!"),
  Review(score: 5, title: "Great easy to use app.", text: "I live in Las Vegas and there are always a ton of events going on. This app makes it easy to view the events around me with different search filters. The interface is nice and simple and it’s easy to get connected to sites where you can purchase tickets to the events. It has a much wider variety than other search engines and apps I typically use. Would highly recommend it!"),
  Review(score: 5, title: "So innovative", text: "I love the concept of swiping through events like a dating app! I never write reviews, but I’ve never seen that done before. This app is so easy to use, so much better than scrolling for hours trying to find an interesting event going on websites that have a million ads. I have already put all my friends on, 11/10"),
